The Chaocipher: 

Invented by John Francis Byrne in the early 20th century, the chaocipher is a polyalphabetic encryption method involving just two rotating disks. 

For over 90 years, the cipher went uncrackable until 2010, when his daughter-in-law donated his materials involving the cipher, thus revealing its algorithm.

In order to simplify the explanation of the algorithm, we're going to represent each disk and its alphabet using strings instead. 

The algorithm involves a zenith (meaning the highest point) and a nadir (meaning the lowest point), corresponding to the top and bottom of each circle.
