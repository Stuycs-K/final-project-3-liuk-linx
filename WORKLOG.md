# Work Log

## Kevin Liu

### 05/18/23

- Research information about the chaocipher algorithm
- Got started on a visualization in Processing

## 05/21/23

- Translated algo described in resources into Processing.
- Got a wheel class up and running

## 05/22/23

- Did research into rotation
- Created a method to rotate wheel, and a display and rotate method for 
wheel

## 05/23/23

- Connected wheels so they rotate how actual wheels do, incorporated the 
cipher shifts and a way to express decoded messages
- Added way to decode message

## 05/24/23
- added animation to cipher shift

## 04/25/23
- added modes switches between quick-slow and encode-decode
### date y


## Xinqing Lin

### 05/18/23

- Research information about the chaocipher algorithm

### 05/20/23

- Got started on a brief history for the presentation file
- Started on an explanation of the algorithm

### 5/22/23

- Got started on a python encoder

### 5/23/23

- Finished the python encoder
- Finished the python decoder
- Added comments for each step in the process for both encoding and decoding

### 5/24/23

- Added a reset button to the Demo on Processing to clear the text after encrypting
- Debugged problem with wheels' rotation

### 5/25/23

- Wrote the README.md
