# Chaocipher

The Chaocipher is a cipher based on two rotating disks. We have a python encoder and decoder as well as a visualization on Processing to explain the algorithm. 

In order to use the python encoder/decoder, open your terminal and run the following command:
```
run python3 message.txt
```
(message.txt being a text file containing the message you want to encrypt/decrypt.)

In order to use the visualizer:
- run ```Demo.pde``` in Processing. 
    - The program will start in Encrypting mode and with the visualizing animation on. In order to toggle the visualization off, press the ```m``` button. 
- In order to encrypt, locate the plaintext character on the right disk and move it to the zenith position (under the green box). Then, press the **space**  button.
- Continue locating the plaintext character on the right disk and the encrypted message will appear in the space below the disks.
